I've just finished work on MoBiller, an iOS app that streamlines capturing patient details, recording billing codes, and generating billing reports for healthcare providers.

The project involved prototyping with React Native and Expo for rapid iteration and early user testing, followed by detailed design work in Figma, and final development using React Native with Unistyles for the design system.

A key challenge was ensuring the app could reliably scan and parse patient sticker details, which formed the backbone of the workflow. Validating this functionality early allowed me to refine the experience before committing to the full design.
