While searching for the latest ways that designers are collecting and storing inspiration, I came across this comment on Reddit:

> Right now just Figma for images and Airtable for articles, but I miss Small Victories. It was great to just dump a screenshot or image into a dropbox folder and let it populate to a small site.

Small Victories was a company I co-founded that took files in a Dropbox folder and turned them into a website. When you updated a file in one of your Small Victories site folders, we automatically rebuilt your site.

It's been years since we shut it down, but it's nice to see people still remember it. Over 10,000 users built 10,000 sites with Small Victories before we closed.

The simplicity of dropping files into Dropbox and having a website appear was something special. Sometimes the best products are the ones that just get out of your way.

It's still more difficult than it should be to put files on the internet to share with the world.
