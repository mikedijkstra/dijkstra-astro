I'm Mike Dijkstra, a web and mobile designer-developer based in Sydney. I've been building software for over a decade, working across the entire product lifecycle from ideation to full stack development.

This blog is where I'll share what I'm learning, working on, and thinking about. Expect posts about software development, product design, AI tools, and the intersection of business goals with engineering realities.

I've worked on everything from iOS apps that scan patient stickers to VR game platforms to automated website builders. Along the way, I've learned that the most interesting problems happen when you're connecting the dots between what users need, what businesses want, and what's actually possible to build.

Recent projects include building MoBiller, an iOS app for healthcare billing, and working on A Township Tale's web and desktop platforms. I've also been experimenting heavily with AI coding tools and how they're changing the way we write software.

Whether you're working on something interesting, have thoughts on a post, or just want to say hello, feel free to [get in touch](/contact).

Thanks for reading ✌️
