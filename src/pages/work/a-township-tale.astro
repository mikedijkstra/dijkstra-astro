          <p class="text-2xl">
            As Lead Front-end Engineer for Alta I was responsible for all the
            user facing applications used by players and staff for their
            flagship game, A Township Tale.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The Township Tavern, a companion application for A Township Tale,
            was a new project I wireframed, designed and developed which allows
            players to view the latest store rotations, purchase virtual
            currency and cosmetics, discover and manage game servers, manage
            their friend lists and manage their account.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            Wireframes and designs were done in Figma, the application was built
            using React, Remix, Cypress, Tailwind and I worked closesly with the
            Platform API developers during development to implement new
            endpoints required for the features we wanted to support.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The HQ was a complete rebuild of an internal dashboard application.
            This application was also wireframed, designed and developed in
            Figma and built using React, Remix and Tailwind.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The Game Launcher was an existing Electron application which I
            upgraded from version 4 to version 18 while also updating the design
            and adding new features.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The marketing website was an existing Next.js application which I
            maintained and updated as required.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            I also setup an image proxy which leveraged caching on Vercel to
            retrieve and serve images from the Township Tale API and Google
            Cloud Storage.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            To support the various front-end applications I created two
            supporting libraries. The first was a React Component Library which
            was developed using Storybook, bundled with rollup.js and imported
            into each application. The second was an API Client library which
            was developed in Typescript and bundled with rollup.js and used to
            interact with the Township Tale API in each application.
