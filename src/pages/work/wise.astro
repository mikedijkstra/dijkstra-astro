          <h2 class="text-3xl">Shared reading lists for teams</h2>
          <p class="text-2xl">
            Wise is a company I co-founded with Tim Howard through Front Row
            Ventures.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            Wise has been through three major iterations. The first was a
            Twitter only version where organisations could create a shared
            reading list for their team. Wise would record what a user had read
            and this could be used towards their accreditation.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The second iteration of Wise enabled organisations and companies to
            create a culture of continuous learning. Targetting associations of
            certified public accountants we launched an iOS app, Android app,
            Ruby on Rails API and a Ember.js web application. The mobile
            applications were for end users while the Ember.js application was
            for learning adminstrators to curate reading lists and analyse
            reports. Wise would record articles users read and track this
            against their reading goal. In addition we developed an
            recommendation engine which would analyse and classify articles
            shared through Wise and recommend other relevant articles to list
            administrators.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The third and current iteration of Wise is a Slack only shared
            reading list. We took the basic elements from the previous version
            and simplified it to create an easy way for teams to share
            interesting articles.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            I developed the first version of Wise as a Ruby on Rails application
            which connected to Twitter for authentication and the streaming API.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            For the second version of Wise I developed the iOS application in
            Swift, the API in Ruby on Rails and the adminstrator dashboard in
            Ember.js. The recommendation was a combination of Ruby and Python as
            there was better support for article ingestion and classification in
            Python. I oversaw the outsourced development of the Android
            application.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            The current version of Wise has been built with the help of Artan
            Sinani and is a Ruby on Rails application with a Python content
            parser, this is the same technology used in the previous versions
            recommendation engine.
          </p>

          <p class="text-2xl">
            All versions of Wise have been hosted on Heroku and use Circle CI
            for continuous integration.
